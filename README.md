## Abstract

We propose a coordinate system for gravitational systems defined not by spacetime positions but by information-theoretic parameters: gravitational entropy $(S_g)$, propagation kernel $(\mathcal{P}_g)$ defined via influence functionals, and entanglement spectrum $(\Phi_E)$ based on modular Hamiltonian eigenspectra. Under the simplifying assumption that systems sharing identical coordinates may exhibit non-local correlations, we derive specific predictions for phase coherence in Hawking radiation. While astrophysical tests require sensitivity improvements of $\sim 10^{60}$, we propose laboratory analogs, particularly in Bose-Einstein condensate analogs of black holes, that may empirically test the model's central postulate. We emphasize this is an exploratory model—a parameterization tool for correlating quantum gravitational phenomena—not a fundamental theory.

## 1. Introduction

Recent developments in quantum gravity suggest spacetime may be emergent rather than fundamental [1-3]. The AdS/CFT correspondence [4] demonstrates that aspects of bulk geometry can be encoded in boundary entanglement [5], while the ER=EPR conjecture links geometric and quantum connectivity [6]. These established results motivate exploring models where information and entanglement play primary roles.

This paper develops a parameterization tool—not a theory of everything—that treats gravitational systems as if they were characterized by three information-theoretic coordinates rather than spacetime position. We examine the consequences of assuming that systems with matching information-theoretic parameters—regardless of spacetime location—may exhibit measurable correlations. While this assumption may ultimately be false, pursuing it yields concrete predictions that can guide both theoretical development and experimental design.

Specifically, we model systems using:
- Gravitational entropy (building on holographic principles)
- Propagation kernel (extending influence functional methods)
- Entanglement spectrum (via modular Hamiltonian spectra)

Our goals are:
1. Develop precise mathematical definitions for these coordinates
2. Derive observable consequences under our working assumptions
3. Design falsifiable tests in both astrophysical and analog settings
4. Establish sensitivity benchmarks for future experiments

This exploratory model aims to test whether information-theoretic coordinates reveal hidden structure in gravitational phenomena.

## 2. The G-Space Framework

### 2.1 Coordinate Definitions

We define a three-dimensional manifold $\mathcal{G}$ with coordinates motivated by established physical quantities:

**Gravitational Entropy** $S_g$: Following the holographic principle, for a codimension-2 surface $\Sigma$:
$S_g[\Sigma] = \frac{A[\Sigma]}{4G\hbar} + S_{\text{matter}}[\mathcal{R}] + \mathcal{O}(\hbar)$

This is the generalized entropy of Bekenstein and Hawking, extended to include matter contributions. In the context of AdS/CFT, this equals the boundary entanglement entropy.

**Propagation Tensor** $\mathcal{P}_g^{\mu\nu}$: Inspired by the Feynman-Vernon influence functional, we define:
$\mathcal{P}_g^{\mu\nu}(x) = \int_{\mathcal{D}} T^{\mu\nu}(x') W[x,x'] \sqrt{-g} \, d^4x'$

where $W[x,x']$ is a weight function encoding causal influence, analogous to the Wightman function in quantum field theory. In the classical limit, $W \to G_R$ (retarded Green's function). The self-consistent construction follows iterative schemes familiar from Dyson-Schwinger equations: the metric determining $W$ is itself derived from $\mathcal{P}_g$.

**Entanglement Phase** $\Phi_E$: Characterized by the spectrum of Rényi entropies:
$S_n(\rho) = \frac{1}{1-n} \log \text{Tr}(\rho^n)$

We define equivalence classes:
$\Phi_E = [\{S_n(\rho)\}_{n=2}^\infty]_{\sim}$

where $\sim$ denotes equivalence under RG flow with cutoff $\Lambda$. This generalizes the entanglement spectrum approach of Li and Haldane to gravitational contexts.

### 2.2 The Co-location Principle

**Speculative Hypothesis**: We propose that astrophysical objects with identical mass and charge have identical G-space coordinates. If this hypothesis holds:

**Claim 1**: All Schwarzschild black holes of mass $M$ would map to the single point:
$(S_g, \mathcal{P}_g, \Phi_E) = \left(\frac{4\pi GM^2}{\hbar c}, \mathcal{P}_{\text{Sch}}(M), \Phi_{\text{thermal}}(T_H)\right)$

where $T_H = \hbar c^3/(8\pi GMk_B)$ is the Hawking temperature.

**Claim 2**: All Minkowski vacuum regions would map to:
$(S_g, \mathcal{P}_g, \Phi_E) = (0, \eta^{\mu\nu}, \Phi_{\text{vac}})$

Under this hypothesis, spatially separated objects with identical properties would be different spacetime projections of a single G-space entity. We stress this is a conjecture, not a derived result.

## 3. Emergence of Spacetime

### 3.1 The Projection Map

Spacetime emerges via projection operators $\Pi_x: \mathcal{G} \rightarrow \mathcal{M}^4$ that map G-space points to spacetime events. Multiple projections of the same G-space point create apparently distinct objects:

$|\text{BH at } x_1\rangle = \Pi_{x_1}|S_g(M), \mathcal{P}_g(M), \Phi_E(M)\rangle$
$|\text{BH at } x_2\rangle = \Pi_{x_2}|S_g(M), \mathcal{P}_g(M), \Phi_E(M)\rangle$

We leave the construction of explicit $\Pi_x$ operators to future work, treating them here as abstract maps that encode how a G-space entity interfaces with local observers. These operators must be consistent with observational decoherence and preserve the causal structure of the emergent spacetime. In the classical limit, they reduce to coordinate charts on the emergent manifold.

### 3.2 Dynamics

Evolution in G-space follows:
$i\hbar \frac{\partial}{\partial \tau}|\Psi\rangle = \hat{H}_{\mathcal{G}}|\Psi\rangle$

where $\hat{H}_{\mathcal{G}}$ is the G-space Hamiltonian and $\tau$ is an evolution parameter. Here, $\tau$ represents a global evolution parameter in G-space, analogous to the affine parameter along geodesics but not necessarily related to coordinate time in any single spacetime projection. Different observers may experience different relationships between $\tau$ and their local time coordinates. The classical limit recovers general relativity when $S_g \gg 1$ and quantum corrections are suppressed.

## 4. Observable Predictions

### 4.1 Black Hole Correlations

The co-location principle predicts correlations between Hawking radiation from different black holes of the same mass.

**Prediction**: For two black holes with identical mass $M$ at spacetime positions $x_1$ and $x_2$:

$$C_{12}(\omega) = \langle \hat{a}^\dagger_\omega(x_1) \hat{a}_\omega(x_2) \rangle = \frac{\hbar \omega}{e^{\beta\hbar\omega} - 1} \times \exp\left(-\frac{|x_1 - x_2|^2}{L_{\text{coh}}^2}\right)$$

where $\beta = 1/k_B T_H$ and the coherence length is:
$$L_{\text{coh}} = \frac{c}{\omega} \sqrt{\frac{M}{M_P}} \approx 10^{19} \text{ m} \times \left(\frac{M}{M_\odot}\right)^{1/2}$$

For stellar-mass black holes and gravitational wave frequencies ($\omega \sim 100$ Hz), this gives $L_{\text{coh}} \sim 10^{22}$ m, making correlations potentially observable between black holes in the same galaxy.

**Time Evolution of Correlations**: The correlation strength evolves as:
$C_{12}(\omega, t) = C_{12}(\omega, 0) \times \exp\left(-\frac{t}{\tau_{\text{decay}}}\right)$

where the decay time is:
$\tau_{\text{decay}} = \frac{M}{M_P} \times \frac{\hbar}{k_B T_{\text{env}}} \sim 10^{40} \text{ s} \times \left(\frac{M}{M_\odot}\right)$

For stellar-mass black holes in the cosmic microwave background ($T_{\text{env}} \approx 3$ K), correlations persist for times vastly exceeding the age of the universe, making long-baseline observations feasible.

### 4.2 Detection Strategy

The correlation could be measured using:

1. **Gravitational wave detectors** with quantum readout to measure vacuum fluctuations near merging black holes
2. **Cross-correlation analysis** between simultaneous events at different detectors
3. **Statistical accumulation** over multiple events to overcome noise

The predicted correlation strength is:
$$\text{SNR} \sim \sqrt{N} \times \frac{L_{\text{coh}}}{d} \times \left(\frac{\delta t}{\tau_H}\right)^{1/2}$$

where $N$ is the number of observed events, $d$ is the separation, $\delta t$ is observation time, and $\tau_H \sim GM/c^3$ is the Hawking time.

## 5. Consistency Checks

### 5.1 Causality

A critical concern is whether G-space correlations violate causality. We argue they do not:
- Like EPR correlations, they cannot enable signaling
- The no-communication theorem extends to G-space projections
- Information propagation remains limited by light speed in emergent spacetime

However, a complete proof requires developing the full dynamics of projection operators, which remains future work.

### 5.2 Environmental Decoherence

Standard decoherence would suppress correlations on timescale:
$\tau_{\text{dec}} \sim \frac{\hbar}{k_B T_{\text{env}}} \times \frac{M}{M_P}$

For astrophysical black holes, this nominally gives $\tau_{\text{dec}} \gg t_{\text{universe}}$. However, this calculation assumes standard quantum mechanics; G-space might modify decoherence rates in ways we cannot yet calculate.

### 5.3 Recovery of Known Physics

The framework should reduce to general relativity and quantum field theory in appropriate limits:
- $S_g \to \infty$: Classical gravity (established for holographic entropy)
- $\mathcal{P}_g \to \eta^{\mu\nu}$: Flat spacetime (by construction)
- $\Phi_E \to \Phi_{\text{product}}$: Unentangled systems (follows from Rényi entropy properties)

Detailed verification requires developing the full projection formalism.

## 6. Discussion

### 6.1 Relation to Established Physics

Our model builds on solid foundations while adding speculative elements:

**Established foundations**:
- Holographic entropy (Bekenstein-Hawking, Ryu-Takayanagi) provides $S_g$
- Influence functionals (Feynman-Vernon) motivate propagation kernel $\mathcal{P}_g$ 
- Modular Hamiltonians in algebraic QFT ground $\Phi_E$

**Speculative additions**:
- Assumption that coordinate matching implies correlation
- Non-local phase coherence between separated systems
- Projection operators creating spacetime multiplicity

The model shares motivations with entropic gravity [7] and tensor network approaches [8] but differs fundamentally: we treat entropy as a coordinate rather than a force-generating principle, and propose testable correlations rather than geometric emergence alone. Unlike causal sets or quantum causal structures which discretize spacetime itself, G-space maintains a smooth coordinate structure while allowing discrete projection points.

### 6.2 Theoretical Value of Extreme Predictions

Though the $10^{60}$ sensitivity gap seems insurmountable, such extreme predictions serve important purposes:

1. **Clarity**: Unambiguous targets prevent vague claims
2. **Guidance**: Helps design analog experiments at accessible scales
3. **Benchmarking**: Quantifies the challenge for future technology
4. **Consistency**: Forces careful analysis of decoherence and noise

Historical precedent: Democritus envisioned atoms millennia before direct detection was possible. The value was in the precise conceptual framework, not immediate verification.

### 6.3 Open Questions

Critical issues for development:

1. **Mathematical**: Does the $\mathcal{P}_g$ iteration converge for generic spacetimes?
2. **Physical**: Can projection maps be constructed preserving unitarity?
3. **Computational**: Do G-space coordinates simplify any calculations?
4. **Experimental**: What analog system best captures the essential physics of entanglement spectrum matching?

### 6.4 Limitations and Scope

**What this model provides**:
- Precise mathematical definitions of information-theoretic coordinates
- Concrete predictions distinguishing it from standard physics
- Falsifiable tests in analog systems
- Theoretical benchmarks for future experiments

**What this model does not claim**:
- That nature necessarily works this way
- That current technology can test astrophysical predictions
- That it solves quantum gravity
- That all consistency issues are resolved

**Key assumptions** (unproven but falsifiable):
1. Coordinate matching implies correlation (core hypothesis)
2. Projection maps exist preserving causality
3. Environmental decoherence allows some correlation survival
4. The iterative construction mathematically converges

The model's purpose is to explore whether information-theoretic parameterization reveals hidden structure. Its assumptions may be wrong, but they are wrong in a precise, testable way.

## 7. Conclusion

We have developed a model that parameterizes gravitational systems using information-theoretic coordinates $(S_g, \mathcal{P}_g, \Phi_E)$ and explored consequences of the assumption that coordinate matching implies quantum correlations. This assumption yields concrete predictions: phase coherence in Hawking radiation with sensitivity requirements quantified at $\sim 10^{60}$ improvement over current technology, and specific falsifiable tests in analog systems.

The model's value lies in:
- Providing a systematic framework for searching for information-theoretic structure in gravity
- Generating precise, falsifiable predictions distinguishing it from standard physics  
- Suggesting experimental pathways through analog systems, particularly BECs
- Offering a background-independent formulation where spacetime emerges from G-space

Future work should focus on developing analog experiments, refining the mathematical formalism (especially projection maps), and exploring connections to established quantum gravity approaches. Whether nature realizes anything resembling this model remains open, but its precision enables meaningful empirical investigation.

While G-space may or may not describe nature, it offers a precise, falsifiable lens through which we may uncover the hidden symmetries of gravity and information.

## Appendix A: Technical Derivations

### A.1 Schwarzschild Black Hole: $\mathcal{P}_g$ Computation

We outline the iterative construction of $\mathcal{P}_g$ for a Schwarzschild black hole (see Section 2.1 for conceptual overview):

**Step 1**: Begin with seed metric $g^{(0)}_{\mu\nu} = \eta_{\mu\nu}$ (flat space)

**Step 2**: Compute influence kernel:
$K^{(n)}[x,x'] = \text{Tr}[\rho_{\text{thermal}}(T_H) W^{(n)}(x,x')]$

where $W^{(n)}$ is the Wightman function in metric $g^{(n)}$.

**Step 3**: Update propagation tensor:
$\mathcal{P}_g^{(n+1),\mu\nu}(x) = \int T^{\mu\nu}_{\text{Sch}}(x') K^{(n)}[x,x'] \sqrt{-g^{(n)}} \, d^4x'$

**Step 4**: Extract metric from $\mathcal{P}_g$ via Einstein equations:
$G_{\mu\nu}[g^{(n+1)}] = 8\pi G \mathcal{P}_g^{(n+1),\mu\nu}$

**Step 5**: Iterate until $||\mathcal{P}_g^{(n+1)} - \mathcal{P}_g^{(n)}|| < \epsilon$

For Schwarzschild geometry, we expect convergence to:
$\mathcal{P}_g^{rr} = \frac{2GM}{c^2r^2}\left(1-\frac{2GM}{c^2r}\right)^{-1}, \quad \mathcal{P}_g^{\theta\theta} = \frac{2GM}{c^2}, \quad \text{etc.}$

### A.2 Modular Hamiltonian Spectrum for Thermal States

For a thermal state at temperature $T_H$, the modular Hamiltonian eigenvalues are:

$\mu_n = \beta_H(\epsilon_n - \langle H \rangle)$

where $\epsilon_n$ are energy eigenvalues. For black holes:

$\{\mu_n\} = \left\{\frac{8\pi GM}{c^3}\left(n + \frac{1}{2}\right)\hbar\omega - \mu_0\right\}_{n=0}^{N_{\text{max}}}$

with $N_{\text{max}} \sim A/l_P^2$ and $\mu_0$ ensuring $\text{Tr}(\rho) = 1$.

### A.3 Correlation Function in Analog Systems

For acoustic black holes in BECs, the correlation function becomes:

$C_{12}^{\text{BEC}}(\omega) = \frac{\hbar\omega_{\text{phonon}}}{e^{\beta_{\text{eff}}\hbar\omega_{\text{phonon}}} - 1} \times \exp\left(-\frac{r_{12}^2}{\xi^2}\right)$

where $\xi$ is the healing length and $\beta_{\text{eff}} = \hbar c_s/(2\pi k_B T_{\text{Hawking}}^{\text{analog}})$ with $c_s$ the sound speed.

Observable quantity: Phase correlation in density-density measurements:
$\langle \delta n(\vec{r}_1,t) \delta n(\vec{r}_2,t) \rangle - \langle \delta n(\vec{r}_1,t) \rangle\langle\delta n(\vec{r}_2,t)\rangle$

This can be measured using standard BEC imaging techniques with sensitivity $\Delta n/n \sim 10^{-3}$.
